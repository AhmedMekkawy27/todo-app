## My process

### Built with

- React.js
- Next.js
- Tailwindcss
- TypeScript

### What I learned

During this project through try and error, I learned a lot of important things like Redux, TypeScript and how to toggle between light mode and dark mode using tailwind.

### Continued development

I still want to add a lot of features like: let the user determine the start and end dates of every todo. Also, I want to add a drag and drop feature, and a lot of other ones.
